<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a first-year master’s student at the Communication University of China. Previously, I received my bachelor’s degree from China University of Petroleum (Beijing).

My early research focused on computer vision, and over time I expanded into deep learning and natural language processing. I am now primarily interested in the development and application of large language models and intelligent agents.

My long-term research interests include:

* Large Language Models
* Deep Learning

    Representative Work: Some research on Agents

    I’m open for academic collaborations. If you are interested, please feel free to email me.
